### *Zero-Knowledge Reputation for Trustworthy Users on Blockchain*

# **Enterprise Pitch (Refined)**

## **What is the Proof of Clean Hands Protocol?**

The **Proof of Clean Hands Protocol** is a Zero-Knowledge, reputation-based verification layer that ensures **users interacting with your platform are trustworthy, compliant, and maintain a clean behavioral trace across time** — without ever revealing private data.

It blends:

* **Stellar** for high-performance, auditable operations
* **Noir (ZK)** for privacy-preserving validation
* **A gamified reputation system** that continuously evaluates users’ integrity

This creates a new standard for **trust on blockchain**, designed specifically for enterprises.

# **The Core Value Proposition**

### **“Verify if a user is trustworthy — without spying on them.”**

The protocol gives companies cryptographic guarantees that a user’s past interactions, patterns, and behaviors are clean, legitimate, and non-fraudulent.
This is done using Zero-Knowledge proofs, ensuring **no private information is leaked, ever**.

The result is a **reputation layer** that is:

* ✔ **Universal** — works across apps, chains, and systems
* ✔ **Tamper-proof** — verifiable on Stellar
* ✔ **Privacy-first** — powered by Noir
* ✔ **Engaging** — enhanced with gamified reputation mechanics

# **We Don’t Score People. We Score Behavior.**

Instead of traditional scoring (which is invasive and outdated), the Proof of Clean Hands Protocol evaluates *behavioral patterns* through ZK proofs:

* Honest participation
* Rule compliance
* Fraud avoidance
* Positive contribution
* Long-term reliability

A user’s reputation is represented through **progression levels, streaks, badges, and trust tiers** — all provable without revealing the underlying data.

---

# **Why Enterprises Need This**

### **1. Reduce fraud and abuse**

Detect risky actors *before* they exploit your system — using cryptographically verified behavioral history.

### **2. Lower compliance costs**

Automate multi-year verification using short, efficient ZK attestations.

### **3. Create safer ecosystems**

Marketplaces, financial platforms, gaming economies, proptech, supply chain portals — all benefit from trusted participants.

### **4. Increase conversion**

Good users gain instant approvals, faster onboarding, and higher trust limits.

### **5. Compete in a world where trust is a currency**

Enterprises that use provable trust outperform those relying on traditional verification.

# **Gamified Reputation System (High-Level Overview)**

Each user has a **private reputation state**, updated through:

* Successful clean operations
* Verified rule adherence
* Completion of trust-building actions
* Time-based progression
* Community interactions (optional)

Enterprises only see the **ZK-verified trust level**, not the internal data.

This creates *incentives for users* and *safety for companies*, without sacrificing privacy.

# **Business Model: B2B Subscription**

A clean and scalable SaaS model:

### **Enterprise Plans**

* Integration SDK
* Automated ZK generation and verification
* Reputation dashboards
* Policy customization engine
* API rate tiers
* SLA + dedicated support

### **Per-User or Per-Proof Pricing Add-ons**
